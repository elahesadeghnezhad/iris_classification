## Iris Classification with Neural Networks
This repository contains Python code for classifying the Iris dataset using a simple neural network. The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries: TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

### Install the required libraries:
pip install tensorflow scikit-learn matplotlib

### Run the iris.py script:
python iris.py

## The script will:
Load the Iris dataset.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Create a neural network model with one hidden layer.
Train the model using the training data.
Evaluate the modelâ€™s accuracy on the test data.
Print a classification report.
Make predictions for new samples.
## Results
The trained model achieves an accuracy of approximately 97% on the test data.
